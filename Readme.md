# GDGC Robotics Hacktoberfest Repository

Welcome to the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDGC) Robotics team's Hacktoberfest repository! This project aims to collect various OpenCV-based Python scripts for different detection tasks.

## About This Project

This repository is part of our Hacktoberfest celebration, where we encourage GDGC members to contribute their computer vision projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, your contributions are valuable!

## How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`
4. Add your OpenCV-based Python script to the appropriate folder (create one if it doesn't exist)
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add YourFeatureName detection script"`
6. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`
7. Create a Pull Request from your forked repository to this main repository

## Project Structure

Please organize your contributions in the following structure:

```
OpenCV / "Your-Name" /
├── face_detection/
├── car_detection/
└── object_detection

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your code is well-commented 
- Include a brief description of your script in a comment at the top of your file
- If your script requires additional dependencies, please mention them in a `requirements.txt` file in your project folder

## Example Projects

You can contribute scripts for various detection tasks, including but not limited to:

- Face Detection
- Car Detection
- Object Detection
- Emotion Recognition
- Gesture Recognition
- Text Detection
- Color Detection
